# Understanding Recycling Basics

## What is Recycling?
Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. It's an alternative to conventional waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions.

## Why Recycle?
- **Conserves Natural Resources**: Recycling reduces the need to grow, harvest, or extract new raw materials from the Earth
- **Saves Energy**: Making products from recycled materials requires less energy than making products from virgin materials
- **Reduces Pollution**: Recycling reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills and incinerators
- **Protects Ecosystems**: By reducing the need for extracting raw materials, we preserve rainforests, wetlands, and other natural habitats

## Common Recyclable Materials
1. **Paper & Cardboard**: Newspapers, magazines, cardboard boxes
2. **Plastic**: Bottles, containers (check the recycling number)
3. **Glass**: Bottles and jars
4. **Metal**: Aluminum cans, tin cans, steel food containers

## The Three R's
- **Reduce**: Use less to begin with
- **Reuse**: Find ways to use items multiple times
- **Recycle**: Process materials to make new products

## Quick Tips
- Rinse containers before recycling
- Remove caps and lids (they may be different materials)
- Don't bag recyclables - they should be loose in the bin
- When in doubt, check your local recycling guidelines

# Composting 101

## What is Composting?
Composting is nature's process of recycling decomposed organic materials into a rich soil known as compost. It's one of the best ways to reduce waste while creating something beneficial for your garden.

## Benefits of Composting
- **Reduces Waste**: Diverts 30% of household waste from landfills
- **Enriches Soil**: Creates nutrient-rich humus for gardens
- **Reduces Methane**: Prevents organic waste from producing methane in landfills
- **Saves Money**: Free fertilizer for your plants!

## What Can You Compost?

### Greens (Nitrogen-Rich)
- Fruit and vegetable scraps
- Coffee grounds and filters
- Tea bags
- Fresh grass clippings
- Plant trimmings

### Browns (Carbon-Rich)
- Dry leaves
- Shredded newspaper
- Cardboard (torn into small pieces)
- Wood chips
- Straw or hay

## What NOT to Compost
❌ Meat or fish
❌ Dairy products
❌ Oils and fats
❌ Pet waste
❌ Diseased plants

## Basic Composting Steps
1. **Choose a Location**: Pick a dry, shady spot
2. **Layer Materials**: Alternate greens and browns
3. **Add Water**: Keep it moist like a wrung-out sponge
4. **Turn Regularly**: Mix every 1-2 weeks for faster decomposition
5. **Harvest**: In 2-3 months, you'll have usable compost!

## Quick Tips
- Chop or shred larger items for faster decomposition
- Maintain a balance of greens (wet) to browns (dry) - aim for 1:2 ratio
- If it smells bad, add more browns
- If it's not breaking down, add more greens and water
